# grape-leaf-morphometrics

Develop a Python pipeline using a cutting-edge Mask R-CNN to automatically extract key morphological traits from grape leaf images.
Analyze traits, including leaf area, length, width, height, serration, and lobe count.
Process historical leaf photographs from the Geneva location
Create a reliable, reproducible workflow for future leaf analysis

## Description

This project aims to enhance an existing pipeline for the automated analysis of grape leaf morphology. Using advanced image processing techniques and a Mask R-CNN model, the system will extract quantitative data from leaf images captured in laboratory settings. The project will process over 100 leaf samples, providing precise measurements in centimeters per pixel. The analysis will focus on both structural features (area, dimensions, lobing) and surface characteristics (venation patterns, serration).
## Scope

    In Scope:
        Processing of existing leaf images from the Geneva location
        Development of Python scripts to implement and deploy a cutting-edge Mask R-CNN for leaf trait extraction
        Analysis of specified leaf traits (area, length, width, height, serration, lobe count, perimeter, color, venation)
        Documentation of the pipeline for future use
        Training materials for team members with varying levels of Python experience

   Out of Scope:
        Development of mobile applications or web interfaces
